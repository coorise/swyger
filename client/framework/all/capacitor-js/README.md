**Swyger x Capacitor** is the best to build webview app from your static frontend website!


So it is a free and open source!!!

Note: Look for <a href="https://github.com/coorise/swyger-spa.git">Swyger SPA</a>  in repository to learn how to build a static website.

## Prerequisite:
- SDk for your platforms(Android SDK,...)
- Terminal(command line to run the app for test)
- IDE( to modify the code source): Visual Studio, PhpStorm(recommended),sublimetext 4...etc


## Note:
This Framework, assume you already have built your static files (html,css...), just paste it into ``dist`` folder by having an ``index.js`` as entry file
